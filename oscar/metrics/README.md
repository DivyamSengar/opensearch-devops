# Metrics

Analytics and monitoring system for the OSCAR bot, providing insights into usage patterns, performance, and system health.

## Purpose

The metrics module collects, processes, and analyzes data about bot interactions, performance metrics, and system behavior to enable monitoring and optimization.

## Core Components

### Data Processing
- **data_processors.py** - Transforms raw event data into structured metrics
- **query_builders.py** - Constructs database queries for metric retrieval
- **summary_generators.py** - Creates aggregated summaries and reports

### System Integration
- **lambda_function.py** - AWS Lambda entry point for metrics processing
- **aws_utils.py** - AWS service integrations and utilities
- **metrics_handler.py** - Central coordinator for metrics operations

### Analysis Tools
- **index_explorer.py** - Explores and analyzes data indices and patterns
- **response_builder.py** - Formats metric responses for different consumers
- **helper_functions.py** - Shared utilities and common operations

### Configuration
- **config.py** - Metrics-specific configuration and settings

## Functionality

The metrics system provides:

- **Usage Analytics**: Tracks bot interactions, user engagement, and feature usage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measures response times, error rates, and system health
- **Data Aggregation**: Combines raw events into meaningful insights
- **Report Generation**: Creates summaries and dashboards for stakeholders
- **Trend Analysis**: Identifies patterns and trends in bot usage

## Data Flow

1. **Collection**: Raw events are captured from bot interactions
2. **Processing**: Events are transformed and enriched with metadata
3. **Storage**: Processed metrics are stored for analysis
4. **Analysis**: Data is queried and aggregated for insights
5. **Reporting**: Results are formatted and delivered to consumers

## Modularity

The metrics system is designed for:
- **Scalability**: Can handle varying loads of metric data
- **Flexibility**: New metrics can be added without affecting existing ones
- **Reliability**: Failures in metrics don't impact bot functionality
- **Extensibility**: Additional analysis tools can be integrated easily
