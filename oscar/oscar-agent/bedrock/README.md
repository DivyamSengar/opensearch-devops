# OSCAR Bedrock Integration

The Bedrock integration provides AWS Bedrock agent capabilities for OSCAR, enabling intelligent conversational automation for OpenSearch release management.

## Features

### Intelligent Agent Architecture
- **Supervisor-Router Pattern**: Central supervisor agent that intelligently routes queries between knowledge base and specialist agents
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents for build metrics, integration testing, and release readiness analysis
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Access to OpenSearch documentation, best practices, and release templates

### Core Capabilities

**Documentation & Knowledge**
- OpenSearch configuration and installation guidance
- Best practices and troubleshooting support
- Feature explanations and tutorials
- Release templates and procedures

**Metrics Analysis**
- Build success rates and failure pattern analysis
- Integration test results across platforms and architectures
- Release readiness scoring and component status tracking
- Cross-version performance comparisons

**Communication Automation**
- Automated Slack message generation for release updates
- Template-based messaging with real-time data integration
- User authorization and channel management
- Markdown to Slack formatting conversion

## Integration Points

### AWS Services
- **Amazon Bedrock**: Foundation models and agent orchestration
- **AWS Lambda**: Action group execution and data processing
- **Amazon OpenSearch**: Metrics data storage and retrieval
- **IAM**: Cross-account access and security

### External Integrations
- **Slack API**: Automated messaging and notifications
- **OpenSearch Distribution**: Build and test result data
- **Release Management**: Component status and readiness tracking

## Key Components

### Supervisor Agent
- Routes queries between knowledge base and specialists
- Orchestrates multi-step workflows
- Manages conversation context and history
- Handles user authorization and permissions

### Specialist Agents
- **Build Metrics**: Analyzes distribution builds, component performance, and failure patterns
- **Integration Tests**: Processes test results, identifies failures, provides debugging context
- **Release Readiness**: Evaluates component status, tracks blocking issues, coordinates releases

### Action Groups
- **Communication**: Processes natural language requests to generate and send Slack messages
- **Routing**: Intelligently directs queries to appropriate knowledge sources or specialists

This integration enables natural language interaction with OpenSearch release data and automates routine communication tasks while maintaining security and user authorization controls.
