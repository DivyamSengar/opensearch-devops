# Slack Handler

Manages all Slack-specific functionality, event processing, and platform integration for the OSCAR bot.

## Purpose

The slack handler provides a comprehensive interface to Slack's API and event system, handling authentication, event processing, and Slack-specific features.

## Core Components

### Event Processing
- **slack_handler.py** - Main orchestrator for Slack integration
- **event_handlers.py** - Processes different types of Slack events (mentions, DMs, etc.)
- **message_processor.py** - Parses and validates Slack message formats

### User Interaction
- **slash_commands.py** - Handles custom slash commands and their responses
- **reaction_manager.py** - Manages emoji reactions and their meanings
- **slack_messaging.py** - Handles message sending and formatting

### System Management
- **authorization.py** - Manages Slack app authentication and permissions
- **timeout_handler.py** - Handles request timeouts and retry logic
- **context_manager.py** - Manages Slack-specific context (channels, users, threads)

### Configuration
- **constants.py** - Slack-specific constants and configuration values

## Functionality

The slack handler provides:

- **Event Routing**: Directs different Slack events to appropriate handlers
- **Authentication**: Manages bot tokens and signing secrets
- **Message Threading**: Handles threaded conversations and replies
- **User Management**: Tracks users, channels, and permissions
- **Command Processing**: Executes slash commands and interactive components
- **Error Handling**: Manages Slack API errors and rate limiting

## Integration Points

- **Inbound**: Receives events from Slack via webhooks
- **Outbound**: Sends messages and updates to Slack via API
- **Context**: Provides Slack-specific context to the communication handler
- **Authentication**: Validates requests using Slack's signing mechanism

## Modularity

The handler is designed for:
- **Event Isolation**: Each event type has dedicated processing logic
- **Feature Separation**: Commands, reactions, and messages are handled independently
- **Error Containment**: Failures in one component don't affect others
- **Extensibility**: New Slack features can be added without modifying existing code
