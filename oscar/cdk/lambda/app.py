Placeholder Lambda handler for OSCAR Slack Bot.

This module provides a basic Lambda handler that serves as a placeholder
until the full bot implementation is deployed.

To customize this Lambda function:
1. Replace this file with your own implementation
2. Ensure your main function is named 'lambda_handler'
3. Update requirements.txt with any additional dependencies
4. Redeploy using the deployment script

The function signature must remain: lambda_handler(event, context)
