# OSCAR: OpenSearch Conversational Automation for Releases

> **Status**: 🚧 **In Development** - This project is currently in the planning and design phase.

An AI-powered Slack bot designed to democratize the OpenSearch release process by providing intelligent assistance, workflow automation, and contextual support. OSCAR serves as a conversational interface for release management tasks, reducing barriers to entry for community contributors while maintaining security through comprehensive verification mechanisms.

## 🎯 Project Vision

OSCAR addresses the critical challenge facing the OpenSearch Engineering Effectiveness Team (OSEE): the complex, knowledge-intensive nature of release management that creates barriers for community participation. By leveraging modern AI technologies, OSCAR transforms release management from an expert-only domain into an accessible, conversational experience.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Conversational Interface
- **Natural Language Processing**: Parse complex, multi-part queries about releases and infrastructure
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Maintain conversation state across multi-turn interactions
- **Rich Interactive Elements**: Buttons, modals, cards, and forms for enhanced user experience

### 🔒 Security-First Design
- **Mandatory Verification**: All workflow commands require explicit user confirmation
- **Command Parsing**: Natural language requests converted to discrete, reviewable actions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all operations and decisions
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permission levels based on user roles

### 🧠 Knowledge Management
- **RAG Architecture**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual information access
- **Comprehensive Knowledge Base**: OpenSearch documentation, OSEE Wiki, troubleshooting guides
- **Source Attribution**: Transparent information retrieval with relevance scoring
- **Real-Time Updates**: Automated content ingestion and knowledge base versioning

### ⚡ Workflow Automation
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol for standardized system communication
- **Multi-System Orchestration**: Unified interface for Jenkins, GitHub, and metrics systems
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous status tracking with automated notifications
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligent analysis with suggested remediation steps

## 🚀 Use Cases

### Release Status Queries
```
User: "What's the status of the 2.11 release and are there any security blockers?"
OSCAR: 🔍 Analyzing 2.11 release status...
       ✅ Build: Passing (Build #1234)
       🟡 Security: 2 reviews pending
       📊 Tests: 85% coverage
       🔗 [View detailed report]
```

### Workflow Automation
```
User: "Trigger a build for version 3.2"
OSCAR: I understand you want to:
       1. Trigger build for version 3.2
       Proceed? [Yes/No]
User: "Yes"
OSCAR: ✅ Build #5678 initiated for v3.2
       ⏱️ Estimated completion: 45 minutes
       🔔 I'll notify you when complete
```

### Troubleshooting Assistance
```
User: "Build failed with dependency errors"
OSCAR: 🔍 Found similar issues in knowledge base:
       💡 Suggested fixes:
       1. Run dependency validation
       2. Update build configuration
       3. Check version compatibility
