# OSCAR Proof of Concept

This directory contains proof of concept implementations and experimental features for the OSCAR project.

## Contents

### 1. Terminal Interface

**File**: `terminal_interface.py`

A simple terminal-based interface for interacting with the OpenSearch knowledge base. This POC demonstrates the core functionality of querying Amazon Bedrock without the Slack integration.

**Features**:
- Direct interaction with Amazon Bedrock
- Simple command-line interface
- Basic query processing

**Usage**:
```bash
python terminal_interface.py
```

### 2. Terminal Interface with Context

**File**: `terminal_interface_with_context.py`

An enhanced version of the terminal interface that maintains conversation context between queries, similar to how the Slack bot preserves context in threads.

**Features**:
- Conversation context preservation
- Enhanced query processing
- Memory of previous interactions

**Usage**:
```bash
python terminal_interface_with_context.py
```

### 3. AWS ID

**File**: `aws_id.txt`

Contains AWS account information for development and testing purposes.

## Purpose

These proof of concept implementations serve several purposes:

1. **Rapid Prototyping**: Testing core functionality without the complexity of the full Slack integration
2. **Feature Validation**: Validating key features like context preservation before implementing in the main application
3. **Development Testing**: Providing a simpler environment for testing changes to the knowledge base integration
4. **Demonstration**: Showcasing the capabilities of the system in a controlled environment

## Relationship to Main Project

The POC implementations demonstrate core concepts that are fully implemented in the main Slack bot:

| POC Feature | Main Implementation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Basic querying | `query_knowledge_base()` in app.py |
| Context preservation | `get_session_context()` and `store_session_context()` in app.py |
| AWS integration | Full CDK deployment in cdk/ directory |
| Visual feedback | Emoji reactions in app.py |

## Future Work

Potential areas for future POC development:

1. **Multi-modal responses**: Testing image and text responses
2. **Alternative LLM providers**: Experimenting with different models
3. **Enhanced context management**: Testing more sophisticated context handling
4. **Performance optimization**: Benchmarking different approaches
5. **Emoji reaction testing**: Validating visual feedback mechanisms
